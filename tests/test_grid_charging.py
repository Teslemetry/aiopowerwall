"""Unit tests for the grid-charging setter.

``set_grid_charging(enabled)`` writes the *inverse* disallow flag
``site_info.disallow_charge_from_grid_with_solar_installed``. Verified on a
Powerwall 3 gateway (via the Fleet->local sync and a direct local v1r write)
that ``disallow=true`` persists the key as ``true`` while ``disallow=false``
causes the gateway to drop the key entirely (its absence means "grid charging
allowed").
